# E-CartApplication
The E-Cart Application is a Java-based GUI desktop application developed 
using the Java Swing framework. It simulates an e-commerce platform where 
users can browse products by categories, add them to a cart, and generate a 
purchase bill. The system offers features like dynamic product listings, image 
previews, search functionality, and persistent billing via file writing. It focuses 
on enhancing object-oriented programming knowledge, GUI design skills, and 
real-time data processing.
